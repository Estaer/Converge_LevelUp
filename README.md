# Converge-LevelUp Project
An android App that retrieves a list of Java developers in Nairobi.

## Mockups.
These mockups were created using Pencil Project which is a wire framing tool. This tool was used because of the following reasons;
- It's open source with multi-platform support
- It's easy to use.
- It has an important library of shapes for the creation of models and interfaces, with the look and feel of the most popular systems and platforms such as Android, IOS and Windows.

Below is a list of the links to the main project mockups.
